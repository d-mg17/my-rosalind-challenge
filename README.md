This is a proyect will document my journey during the ROSALIND bioinformatics problems.


## About ROSALIND
> "Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving." -ROSALIND webpage

## Structure
1. [Python Village](#python-village)
2. [Bioinformatics Stronghold](#bioinformatics-stronghold)
3. [Bioinformatics Armory](#bioinformatics-armory)
4. [Bioinformatics Textbook Track](bioinformatics-textbook-track)
5. [Algorithmics Heights](#algorithmics-heights)

### Python Village
> "If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold."
### Bioinformatics Stronghold
> "Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others."
### Bioinformatics Armory
> "Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools."
### Bioinformatics Textbook Track
> "A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org"
### Algorithmics Heights
> "A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani."
